# TravelViz UI

This is the React <abbr title="Single-Page Application">SPA</abbr> web frontend for Travel Visualization service.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which bundles together React, Webpack, Babel, Jest and others without manual configuration. For more documentation about the built-in features, see [User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


## Getting started

## Deployment

To build the app for production to the `build` folder, run following in project folder:
